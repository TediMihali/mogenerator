This is a library for genearting multiple types of progressions, 
numbers and passwords. The code is open-source and you can 
give me ideas or contribute directly through github.

Generating_arithmetic_progression:
- generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, step, number_of_terms) -> returns list

Finding the n-th term of an arithmetic progression:
- n_term_arithmetic_progression(first_term, step, index_of_term) -> returns int

Findng the sum of the n first terms of the arithmetic progression:
- n_term_sum_arithmetic_progression(first_term, step:, number_of_terms) -> returns float:

Generating_geometric_progression:
- generate_geometri_progression(first_term, coefficient, number_of_terms) -> returns list

Finding the n-th term of an geometric progression:
- n_term_geometric_progression(first_term, coefficient, index_of_term) -> returns int

Finding the sum of the first n terms in a geometric progression:
- n_term_sum_geometric_progression(first_term: int, q:, number_of_terms) -> returns int:

Generating a harmonic progression:
- generate_harmonic_progression(first_term, step, number_of_terms) -> returns list:

Finding the n term of a harmonic progression:
- n_term_harmonic_progression(first_term, step, n) -> return Fraction

Finding the sum of the first n terms in a harmonic progression:
-n_term_sum_arithmetic_progression(first_term, step, number_of_terms) -> returns float:

Generating a random password with variable levels of security:
- generate_password(security: int) -> returns string:

Generating a random number with n digits:
- generate_number(digits: int) -> returns int:
