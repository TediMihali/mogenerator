This is a library for genearting multiple types of progressions, 
numbers and passwords. The code is open-source and you can 
give me ideas or contribute directly through github.

Generating_arithmetic_progression:
- generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, step, number_of_terms) -> returns list

Finding the n-th term of an arithmetic progression:
- n_term_arithmetic_progression(first_term, step, index_of_term) -> returns int

Generating_geometric_progression:
- generate_geometri_progression(first_term, coefficient, number_of_terms) -> returns list

Finding the n-th term of an arithmetic progression:
- n_term_geometric_progression(first_term, coefficient, index_of_term) -> returns int

Generating a password:
- generate_password(security: int) -> returns string:

- generate_number(digits: int) -> returns int:
